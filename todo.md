If you add or delete a comment, it ruins the limit.
also add page nums to comments

In commits, delete a comment using optimisic rendering, but changed length of comments.

<!-- comments dont go down as they are deleted -->

if on page 3, then sort by 100, no articles

So, if change limit => p = 1

<!-- broken article voting -->

<!-- nav buttons dont show on all articles the /:topic path (only happens if article has less thns 10 comments) -->

aerticles with no comments show a button (not bug, no nav buttons if less than 10 comments)

if you go to 20 comments and then go back to 10, there is no nav buttons (only in comments, not in articles)

add asc desc buttons
